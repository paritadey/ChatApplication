    <b>\"How wonderful it is to be able to write someone a letter! To feel like conveying your thoughts to a person,
        to sit at your desk and pick up a pen, to put your thoughts into words like this is truly marvelous.\"</b>\nâ€• Haruki Murakami, Norwegian Wood\n\n
Previously we used to write letters to our loved ones for anything small and eagerly waited to post our letters and to reach it to the destination. It was time
    consuming. Nowadays we do not have that much time or patience to get our letters posted and reach it to the destination.\n
    Now we are technologically sound to develop messaging service via digital media. We do not write letters in paper but write in android messaging application
    and send it to the other person and it reaches to the destination end in a blink of eyes.\n\n
    This application is a small approach of messaging service. Users need to register into this application via the email address.
        By this application users can connect with other users via searching the email address in this platform. Users can start chatting with other users by
        sending the friend request to others and on accepting the friend request both can chat. \n\n
        This application provides functionalities like:\n
        1. User can send request to any users by searching their email addresses in Add to Contact section\n
        2. On accepting the friend request both the users can chat.\n
        3. User can un-friend or block other person if any problem occurs.\n
        4. Users will get notification on receiving friend request, message arrival.\n\n
        Special Note : This application does not ask for banking details or any kind of OTP. Please beware of sharing the confidential information with other people\n\n\n
